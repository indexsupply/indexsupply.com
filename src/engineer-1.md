# [Index Supply](/) / Engineer \#1

<em style="color: gray">This is not your typical job post</em>

Today Index Supply is a one-man-band. I write the code, maintain the servers, and do the sales. And so far, that has been working well. However, it's time to turn it up a notch. The [SQL API](https://www.indexsupply.net) has started to gain momentum and it is clear that Index Supply is ready for another engineer to scale the product and the company. Since it will be just the two of us, let me tell you a bit about myself.

My name is Ryan Smith and I founded Index Supply in 2022\. Before that I co-founded Chain and before that I was \#18 at Heroku. I am obsessed with systems programming and decentralized tech. You can learn more about my personal engineering style by reading [this page](https://r.32k.io/eng-inspiration) on my personal website. But to sum it up here: I value simplicity and building from first principles.

My ideal candidate is someone who loves understanding details of problems and enjoys finding elegant solutions. Additionally, the ideal candidate will be a junior engineer. I'm not opposed to working with someone who is seasoned, but you will likely get less mentorship value than someone who is just getting started. The only requirement is that you must be a hardcore computer nerd.

Index Supply has an open source project called [Shovel](https://github.com/indexsupply/shovel) which is written in Go. But [the primary product](https://www.indexsupply.net) – the future of the company– is written in Rust. I like Rust and ideally you do too. If you glance over my social posts and public GH projects you will notice a theme: Postgres. I've been building on top of Postgres for over a decade and I know a lot of tricks to make it hum. If you have ever wanted to get knee-deep in Postgres (*i.e. shared buffers, huge pages, b-tree vs. hash, nested loop joins vs. hash joins, etc.*) then this will be a fun job for you. Finally, I value deep understanding of systems when designing solutions and so taking the time to learn and come up with the best solution will be a daily part of the job.

An additional perk is that Index Supply is part of [0xPARC](https://0xparc.org). The 0xPARC organization has many individuals and teams working on cutting edge cryptographic systems. You will be surrounded by world renowned Mathematicians and Cryptographers who are building new internet technologies using [Programmable Cryptography](https://0xparc.org/blog/programmable-cryptography-1).

If you want to apply to work with me at Index Supply, please email [me](mailto:ryan@indexsupply.com) with a message explaining why this is a good opportunity for you. In this email, please include samples of your technical writing (blog posts, commit messages, code comments) and your code (a function snippet, open source repo, gist).

Salary: $150,000 plus health insurance, and a few other perks.
Locations Ordered By Preference: SF, Pacific Time, USA.

## The Interview Process

1. Apply via email (_using aforementioned instructions_)
2. 1hr phone call to mutually introduce ourselves and talk high level about the mission
3. *Option A* or *Option B*
4. Reference checking. I will connect you with people who've worked with me and vice versa

### Option A

If you are able to do contracting work then ideally we can find a good 1-2 week starter project in the Index Supply issue tracker to work on. This will give us both the best clarity on if we have good working chemistry. This will be a paid project and we can iron out the details when the time comes. Otherwise, if you don't have the availability to do contract work, then we can explore Option B.

### Option B

Let's spend a day working together. We will start the day by getting some coffee (or any other beverage) and talking about the possible things to work on. From there I will let you drive on fixing a bug or adding a feature to Index Supply. We will also make time throughout the day for casual conversation. The goal here is to compress Option A into 1 day and to get our best impression of what it would be like to work together.
